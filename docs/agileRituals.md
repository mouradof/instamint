# The Positive Impact of Agile Rituals on the Instamint Project - Article - SYLLA Aboubakar

In the world of software development, adopting agile methodologies often equates to increased flexibility and efficiency. The Instamint project, an innovative social networking platform that merges features from Twitter and Instagram with an NFT marketplace, is no exception. Led by a team of four intermediate-level developers in a work-study program, the project has successfully leveraged agile rituals to navigate through a complex and dynamic environment.

## Adaptation and Flexibility of Monthly Sprints

Though the one-month sprint duration was initially mandated by our academic framework, this structure provided a sustainable rhythm that matched well with our varying schedules. Monthly sprints allowed for effective planning and balanced workload distribution, which is crucial for a team balancing school and professional responsibilities. This duration afforded us the necessary time to develop complex visual functionalities, while still allowing us to revise and adapt our goals based on feedback and market trends in the NFT space.

## Enhanced Team Communication and Cohesion through Weekly Meetings

Choosing weekly meetings every Monday instead of traditional daily stand-ups was a wise adaptation to our schedules. These meetings enhanced communication and team cohesion, enabling us to synchronize our efforts and share individual progress and challenges.

This weekly ritual became a cornerstone for the team, providing a regular checkpoint for strategic alignment and priority management, which is essential in agile software development.

## Using Trello for Visual and Intuitive Project Management

Our use of Trello to track our user stories played a crucial role in the success of the Instamint project. As developers focused on visual functionalities, the intuitive and highly visual nature of Trello aligned perfectly with our workflow.

It enabled each team member to clearly see the progress of tasks, manage dependencies, and adjust priorities in real-time, thus ensuring smooth and continuous progression of the project.

## Benefits of Agile Rituals within an Academic Setting

The academic setting, with its specific constraints and requirements, benefited from the agile rituals we adopted. These rituals allowed the team to remain agile and responsive to changing demands and development challenges, while also providing a structured framework that facilitated continuous assessment by our mentors and professors.

## Conclusion

Agile rituals played a crucial role in the success of the Instamint project. They not only enabled effective project management in a complex educational environment but also enhanced the professional skills of each developer. These methods, tailored to our specific context, demonstrated that even within a mandated framework, flexibility and communication remain key to success in developing innovative and competitive solutions. Instamint is thus a compelling testament to the fact that agility, when properly applied, can transform challenges into opportunities, even for a team facing multiple constraints in a work-study scenario.
