# Innovation Proposals

### 1. Add Stories that a User Can Add and View

**Concept:**
Inspired by platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, "stories" are ephemeral content that allow users to share moments from their daily lives. In the context of Instamint, this could be an innovative way for users to highlight their NFTs or share moments related to their NFT experience.

**Development:**

- **User Interface:**
  Design an intuitive interface where users can post and view stories. This could include features like swiping to move to the next story, a timer indicating the remaining duration of the story, and icons for interaction (e.g., to buy an NFT featured in a story).
- **Storage and Accessibility:**
  Stories are temporary, so a duration after which they are automatically deleted needs to be defined. Additionally, it is necessary to determine how the stories will be stored and retrieved.
- **Interactivity:**
  Allow users to react to stories, perhaps by expressing interest in an NFT or leaving a comment.

### 2. Add a Blockchain Wallet Connection System

**Concept:**
Allow users to connect to the platform using their wallet, offering a secure and convenient method that aligns your platform with web3 standards.

**Development:**

- **Wallet Integration:**
  Choose popular wallets (like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.) to integrate. Then use their respective APIs to enable the connection.
- **Authentication and Security:**
  Authentication via a wallet is inherently secure, but it is important to understand how to properly implement the authentication process to avoid vulnerabilities.
- **User Experience:**
  Clearly explain the benefits and functionality of connecting via a wallet for users who might not be familiar with this technology.
- **Functional Integration:**
  Once connected via their wallet, users should be able to directly use their NFT assets on the platform, such as using them in stories.
