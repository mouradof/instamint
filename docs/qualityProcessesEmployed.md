## Quality Processes Employed

### Vulnerability Detection

A process for monitoring vulnerability flaws has been established to measure and mitigate these vulnerabilities. This cyclical process involves identifying IT assets (or resources) and correlating them with a constantly updated database to identify threats, configuration errors, and vulnerabilities. Another aspect of this management involves assessing the urgency and impact of each vulnerability based on various risk factors and quickly responding to serious threats. Before each change, a report listing the number of flaws and their risk level will be generated. If no flaws are detected, then the change will proceed.

### Server Load Management

A process for managing server load has been implemented to ensure that the server can accommodate all users. This process allows simulating activity on the website and server to observe reactions and measure the stability of the site when used by a large number of users.

### Performance Evaluation

A performance evaluation process has been established to regularly monitor and ensure an optimal user experience. Similar to the server load management process, we will simulate activities on the site and measure the server's response time for each feature.

### Carbon Footprint

To assess the ecological impact of the application, an analysis of the environmental footprint will be conducted and measured. This will help identify the polluting aspects of the application and implement solutions tailored to them.

### Compatibility Process

A compatibility process has been set up with the goal of being able to change hosts quickly and without complications, allowing us not to depend on one service.
