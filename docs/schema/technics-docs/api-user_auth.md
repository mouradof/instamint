# Technical Documentation for the Authentication API Project

## General Architecture

This project is structured around a REST API built with Node.js and utilizes key technologies such as Knex, Objection.js, and Hono to provide authentication and user management functionalities.

### Main Components

1. **BaseModel**: All data models inherit from this base model, which sets up basic integrations with Objection.js, facilitating the use of standardized ORM functions.

2. **UserModel**: Defines the structure and behavior of the user entity in the database. It includes data validation through `jsonSchema` and methods for generating verification tokens.

3. **Migrations**: Knex script to define the database structure. Migrations allow for consistent deployment and controlled evolution of the database.

4. **Seed**: Script to generate fake data to facilitate testing and development without the need for initial real data.

5. **Auth Middleware**: Middleware to verify the JWT provided in requests to secure routes that require authentication.

6. **Email Helper**: Utility to manage email sending, used here for verification emails during user registration.

7. **Password Hashing**: Functions for hashing passwords, using bcrypt to secure stored passwords.

8. **Routes**: Specific routes (`register`, `login`, `verify`) handle different aspects of authentication and user account management.

### Data Flow

- **Registration**: A new user submits their data (username, email, password), which is then validated, hashed, and stored in the database. A verification email is sent.

- **Login**: Verifies user credentials against the database. If valid, a JWT is generated and returned.

- **Verification**: A user submits a verification token (received by email) which, once validated, marks the user's email as verified.

## Security

- **Password Hashing**: Uses bcrypt with salt and pepper to enhance the security of stored passwords.

- **JWT Tokens**: Used for authenticating requests to protected routes. The secret for signing the tokens is stored outside of the source code, in environment variables.

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated against specific schemas before any database operations to prevent SQL injections and other attacks.

## Deployment

- **Docker**: The provided `Dockerfile` prepares the necessary environment to run the API, including all dependencies and configurations.

- **Environment and Configuration**: Critical server and database settings are configured in separate configuration files and loaded via dotenv to facilitate changes without altering the source code.

## Maintenance

- **Dependency Updates**: Package versions are managed through the `package.json` file. It is recommended to test each update in a development environment before deploying in production.

- **Logs**: The current setup uses Hono's `logger` middleware for basic logging. For a production environment, consider integrating a more robust logging system like Winston.

## Conclusion

This documentation aims to provide a clear and technical overview of the components and processes used in the authentication API project. It should be updated with each significant change to the system to remain relevant and useful.
