## Challenges and Blockages

- **Challenges:**
  - Now that I'm more familiar with the project, I want to make as much us as possible, but keep the code clean.
- **Blockages:**
  - For post publication, I had to implement the S3 bucket installed by Lo√Øc, and I encountered quite a few problems along the way (notably with 'process.env').

## Action Plan

- Finish delete post feature. and start publish post feature.
- Conducted research on Bucket S3 implementation

## Conclusion

- I was able to complete the post deletion function, but I ran into some difficulties with the post publishing function. But unlike the previous sprint, I was able to manage my time better and make clean code. I learned a lot from this project ! Thanks to the team for their support.
