### Summary of Developed Features:

During this second sprint, several improvements and additions were made, mainly focused on managing user profiles and sessions. The efforts were divided into two main categories: session management and profile features.

### Changes Made:

#### Session Management:
- **Session Addition and Improvement**: Persistent sessions have been implemented to keep the user's session active even after refreshing the page (F5). This improvement provides a more stable and continuous user experience.
- **Logout Management**: Implementing the logout feature gives users the ability to securely log out of the application.
- **Login and Password Change Management**: Users can now change their passwords under set conditions, enhancing security. Additionally, the retrieval of a logged-in user's information has been optimized.

#### Profile Features:
- **Profile Interface Improvements**: Several fixes have been applied to the profile page, including style updates and various bug corrections to enhance the user experience.
- **Display and Management of Posts**: Users' posts are now visible on their profiles, making the interaction with the profile richer and more engaging.
- **Profile Deletion and Editing**: A new feature allows users to delete their profile after 30 days without connection, helping to keep the database clean and up-to-date. Additionally, users can now edit their profiles more effectively thanks to the redesign of the editing page.
- **Profile and Cover Photo Options**: Users now have the choice between a default or random profile or cover photo, providing more flexible customization of their profile.

### Positive Points:

- **Regular Meetings**: As in the previous sprint, weekly meetings continued to promote good communication within the team, allowing the sharing of progress and challenges encountered.
- **Good Working Atmosphere**: The team maintained a pleasant working atmosphere, which facilitated collaboration and engagement from all members.

### Negative Points:

- **Availability**: The Post API was not immediately available, which prevented me from progressing on the posts.
