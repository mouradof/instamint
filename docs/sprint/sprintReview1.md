# Sprint Review - [22/05/2024]

## Lo√Øc

### Summary of Developed Features:

1. **Configuration:** Setup of config and backend (Basic).
2. **07-Teabag-list:** Creation of the page allowing to display the list of teabags for a user.
3. **08-Teabag-Add:** Implementation of the feature to add a teabag.

### Changelog:

- [Technology Change]: After deliberation, the code will be in JavaScript instead of TypeScript (Configuration has been reviewed). Additionally, the use of the Knex ORM has replaced the old one. Furthermore, Hono will replace the backend with Next.
- [Teabag List]: Addition of the teabag list where the user is present. A counter to see the number of members has been added, and a description as well as the group image has been included.
- [Teabag Addition]: The ability for the user to create a teabag has been added. It allows the user to create a teabag, choose its name, description, invite users, or make the group private. The selection of the group image will be added very soon.

### Positive Points:

- [Regular Meetings]: Every Monday, the team decided to meet to share progress, difficulties, as well as possible questions or important topics to address.
- [Good Atmosphere]: We work in a good atmosphere without animosity. Meetings are not a pain to attend. Everyone listens to what others have to say.
- [Good Will]: Some members of the group show good will and despite the difficulties, they try to code and ask questions.

### Negative Points:

- [Technology Change]: It happened that everyone brought their own technology without considering what had already been done. Consequently, this led to some disagreements and significantly slowed down everyone's progress. Each time a task was finished, it had to be redone to adapt to the technologies. We eventually agreed, but it caused a delay in the project.
- [Difficulty with Microservice]: We had never done a microservice until now. It required a lot of technology watch to produce the first code (still imperfect).
- [Heterogeneity of Practices]: Each person has a different coding style. The group struggles to standardize the code.
